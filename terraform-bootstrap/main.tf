# Run this ONCE, locally, with your already-configured AWS CLI credentials,

# It creates the S3 bucket + DynamoDB table that hold Terraform's remote
# state. Remote state is what lets GitHub Actions run `terraform apply`
# safely (locking, shared state) instead of everyone's local .tfstate
# drifting out of sync.
#
# Usage:
#   cd terraform-bootstrap
#   terraform init
#   terraform apply
#
# Then take the outputs and plug them into terraform/main.tf's backend block.
